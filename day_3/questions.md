## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
  A conditional statement is an if-statement that looks like this: If p, then q, where p is a hypothesis and q is the conclusion. A conditional statement is always true unless a true hypothesis leads to a false conclusion.

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
  If-statements give a way to execute code on a wide range of data using a set of statements to judge that data.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
  if condition
    statement
    statement
    ...
  elsif condition
    statement
    statement
    ...
  else condition
    statement
    statement
    ...
  end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
    We use 'elsif' which will state a condition should our first 'if' statement be false. We can use an endless amounts of 'elsif' statements but they have to be sandwiched in between 'if' and 'end' statements.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
  if condition
    statement
    statement
    ...
  elsif condition
    statement
    statement
    ...
  else condition
    statement
    statement
    ...
  end

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
  Maybe we can use theme to evaluate variables and test them against hypothesis that can make them do one thing or another.
  They are also important in mathematics in which they play a part in deductive reasoning and proof writing.
