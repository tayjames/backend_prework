## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
  A `conditional statement` is an **if-statement** that looks like this: If #p, then #q, where #p is a hypothesis and #q is the conclusion. A `conditional statement` is always true unless a true hypothesis leads to a false conclusion.

  1. *If* it is 04/12/19 at 1:11 pm *then* I am wearing a Canadian Tuxedo. **(T)**
  2. **If** I'm not allergic to strawberries, **then** I can eat strawberries. **(T)**
  3. *If* you are me, **then** you like sour patch kids. **(?)**


1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
  ***If-statements*** give us a way to make decisions with our code by using structures that are inherent to conditionals such as ***else, elsif***.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
  if condition
    statement
    statement
    ...
  elsif condition
    statement
    statement
    ...
  else condition
    statement
    statement
    ...
  end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
    We use `elsif` which will state a condition should our first ``'if'`` statement be false. We can use an endless amounts of `elsif` statements but they have to be sandwiched in between `if` and `end` statements.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
  if condition
    statement
    statement
    ...
  elsif condition
    statement
    statement
    ...
  else condition
    statement
    statement
    ...
  end

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
  Maybe we can use them to evaluate variables and test them against hypothesis that can make them do one thing or another.
  They are also important in mathematics in which they play a part in deductive reasoning and proof writing.
