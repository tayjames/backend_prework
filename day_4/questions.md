## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

  Creating a method gives us a convenient way to run code that we use frequently, by saving said code in one place. This is easier for us to reference for future use, as opposed to having to type the repetitive code time and time again.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

  def hello
    p "Sam I am"
  end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

  def hello_someone(name)
    p "#{name} I am"
  end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
  By typing in the method name with an argument in double quotes.

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
  None that can't be solved with practice!
